This is an example of using kittest with egui.

See [egui_kittest](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_kittest) for a working kittest integration.

⚠️ This example is currently disabled because the accesskit version of kittest differs from that of egui.
If you enable this example again, remember to also update `.github/workflows/rust.yml`.
